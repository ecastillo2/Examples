Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

Letâ€™s say our int has 5 elements:

int[] arr = { 78, 55, 45, 98, 13 };
Now, let us perform Bubble Sort.

Start with the first two elements 78 and 55. 55 is smaller than 78, so swap both of them. Now the list is:

55, 78,45,98, 13
Now 45 is less than 78, so swap it.

55, 45, 78, 98, 3
Now 98 is greater than 78, so keep as it is.

3 is less than 98, so swap it. Now the list looks like:

55, 45, 78, 3, 98
This was the first iteration. After performing all the iterations, e will get our sorted array using Bubble Sort:

3, 45, 55, 78, 93
Let us see an example with 10 elements in an array and sort it.

Example:
using System;

namespace BubbleSort {
   class MySort {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         int[] arr = { 78, 55, 45, 98, 13 };
         int temp;

         for (int j = 0; j <= arr.Length - 2; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= arr.Length - 2; i++) {
               if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                  temp= arr[i + 1];
                  arr[i + 1] = arr[i];
                  arr[i] = temp;
               }
            }
         }

         Console.WriteLine("Sorted:");
         foreach (int p in arr)
            Console.Write(p + " ");
         Console.Read();
      }
   }
}
Output
Sorted:
13 45 55 78 98
